            As a highly skilled full-stack developer, I bring expertise in
            JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS, and modern frameworks such as
            React and Next.js. I am passionate about creating responsive,
            visually engaging, and high-performance user interfaces that enhance
            user experiences. With a strong command of Tailwind CSS, I ensure
            that every design is implemented with precision and attention to
            detail, delivering aesthetically pleasing and functional results.
